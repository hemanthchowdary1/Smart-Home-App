# Overview
This project focuses on the creation of a modern smart home app aimed at enhancing user interaction with home automation systems. The design prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, and functionality, enabling users to easily control and monitor their smart devices.

# Color Palette:
Soft Yellow (#FFD966): Used for highlighting buttons and key interactive elements to ensure visibility and appeal.
Dark Blue (#2B2E4A): For text and headers, providing a professional and readable contrast.
White: Offers a clean background that improves readability and enhances visual clarity.

# User Flow:
The app is designed with a clear and simplified navigation flow, ensuring that users can easily transition from one function to another without confusion or clutter.

# Main Screens
# Device Dashboard:
The main screen displays an overview of all connected devices, giving users quick access to monitor and control their home automation system.

# Individual Device Controls:
Users can access detailed settings for each device, such as adjusting lights, controlling temperature, or turning devices on/off.

# Automation & Scheduling:
Allows users to set up personalized automation routines for various devices (e.g., lighting schedules, thermostat adjustments) to automate home functions based on time or user preferences.

# Sound Monitoring:
Displays real-time noise levels, helping users monitor ambient sound in their home. This is especially useful for monitoring safety or ensuring the home environment is quiet.

# Fan Control:
The fan control screen provides an interface for users to adjust fan speed and oscillation settings. This allows for personalized airflow control, enhancing comfort in any room.

# Structure
screens:
Contains visual representations of the key screens and features within the app, demonstrating the app's functionality.

flow chart:
Includes a flowchart outlining the navigation structure, showing how users move between different screens and functions.

# Exploring the Design
The interactive design can be viewed in Figma, where you can explore the user flow and various features firsthand. You can also download the Figma file for offline review and exploration.

This app design focuses on user-friendly navigation, ensuring that anyone can control their smart home devices without unnecessary complexity. The combination of intuitive design, efficient functionality, and an appealing color scheme creates an optimal user experience.
