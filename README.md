# Overview
This project focuses on the creation of a modern smart home app aimed at enhancing user interaction with home automation systems. The design prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, and functionality, enabling users to easily control and monitor their smart devices.

## Key Features & Screens
# Color Palette:
Soft Yellow (#FFD966): Used for highlighting buttons and key interactive elements to ensure visibility and appeal.
Dark Blue (#2B2E4A): For text and headers, providing a professional and readable contrast.
White: Offers a clean background that improves readability and enhances visual clarity.

# User Flow:
The app is designed with a clear and simplified navigation flow, ensuring that users can easily transition from one function to another without confusion or clutter.

## Main Screens
# Device Dashboard:
The main screen displays an overview of all connected devices, giving users quick access to monitor and control their home automation system.

# Individual Device Controls:
Users can access detailed settings for each device, such as adjusting lights, controlling temperature, or turning devices on/off.

# Automation & Scheduling:
Allows users to set up personalized automation routines for various devices (e.g., lighting schedules, thermostat adjustments) to automate home functions based on time or user preferences.

# Sound Monitoring:
